Highest (Posterior) Density Intervals.

This package has a generic 'hpdi' function and a range of methods for different classes of objects that define a probability density distribution, including MCMC output, fitted kernel density objects, and formulae.

These functions were originally included in the 'BEST' package. This separate package allows them to be used without having to install BEST and its dependencies, which include JAGS.
