# Highest (Posterior) Density Intervals.

This package has a generic `hdi` function and a range of methods for different classes of objects that define a probability density distribution, including MCMC output, fitted kernel density objects, and formulae.

These functions were originally included in the `BEST` package. This separate package allows them to be used without having to install `BEST` and its dependencies, which include JAGS.
